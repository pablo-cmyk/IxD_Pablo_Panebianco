Description:  In this repository there are 30 exercises that experiment with the use of the TouchDesigner programme. There is no common theme, nor any common thread linking them, they are simply experiments, with due credit to those responsible. In these networks I have tried to experiment with as many operators as possible, and when possible to vary and modify. Many works are composed of TOP and CHOP operators, but there is no lack of experiments with SOP and MAT operators.
